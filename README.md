# Cert-Notes-and-Projects

## Overview
This repository serves as my personal hub for documenting my career development journey in cybersecurity and related fields. As a recent graduate focusing on building practical skills, I'm tracking progress toward key goals like earning CompTIA Network+ and Security+ certifications by the end of 2025, completing hands-on projects, and contributing to open-source. 

Expect to see:
- **Certification Notes**: Summaries, key concepts, and study resources for Network+ and Security+.
- **Projects**: Code and documentation for beginner-to-advanced projects in Cybersecurity, Data Science, UI/UX Design, and DevOps. Examples include encryption tools, vulnerability scanners, and AI-based anomaly detectors.
- **Other Artifacts**: Links to my LinkedIn, portfolio site (coming soon), and event notes.
